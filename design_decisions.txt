# Database

## Our use case

- E.g. multiple MORPHs of DBG running on separate nodes, adding their results to
  some table as they go along.  
- E.g. running MORPH for website, with some temp
  data and read-only data that we've prepped before, result returned plainly to
  user 
- E.g. data prep: loading all data into big database

We have NFS storage.

Amount of data: a couple of GB.

## SQLite

In short: SQLite needs to be on a network file system for us to access it on
separate nodes. An SQLite database will become corrupt on NFS when the NFS
implementation doesn't implement file locking properly, and NFS implementations
often don't. Corruption is unacceptable, thus we don't use SQLite.
